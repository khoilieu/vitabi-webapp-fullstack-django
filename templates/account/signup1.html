                        <ul>
                            <li>We can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the individual; or</li>
                            <li>The processing is for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Right to withdraw consent at any time:</strong> You may contact Vitabi to request this. Although we may not be able to accept your request for certain types of data, please contact us if you wish to discuss this further.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-dark fw-bold">DATA RETENTION</h4>
                        <p>We retain Personal Information for as long as it is legally required for the purposes set forth above. We may delete any information from our systems without notice to you once we deem it is no longer necessary for the purposes set forth above.</p>
                        <p>If you withdraw your consent to us processing your Personal Information, we will erase it from our systems (unless the data is required for Vitabi to establish, exercise, or defend against legal claims).</p>
                        <p>In particular, Personal Information provided with respect to your insurance policies will be deleted once no longer needed for us to provide you with services (for example, once the relevant policy expires) unless you have received medical services covered by the policy, in which case we will retain the Personal Information related to that policy as and to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
                        <p>Please note that uninstalling the App from your device will not necessarily cause your Personal Information to be deleted from our systems or from the Service. Most data will be deleted once no longer needed in order to provide you with services (e.g., after your relevant insurance policy expires); however, if you used our services in order to receive any medical services, the data will be retained in accordance with legal requirements.</p>
                        <h4 class="text-dark fw-bold">SURVEYS</h4>
                        <p>From time to time, we may send you surveys or requests to provide feedback (such as scoring service quality) for the purpose of improving service quality. By receiving our services, you provide your express approval to receive such surveys and requests for feedback; However, answering such surveys and/or providing feedback will always be optional, not mandatory (and not a condition to receive the services), and at your sole discretion.</p>
                        <h4 class="text-dark fw-bold">NEWSLETTERS</h4>
                        <p>We may send newsletters, but only to registered users and all newsletters we send will contain an “unsubscribe” link.</p>
                        <h4 class="text-dark fw-bold">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
                        <p>We may change this Policy, in which case we will seek your consent to those changes. If you do not consent to the amended Policy, we may terminate your account and block your access to and use of the Service. Your following usage of the Platform shall also be deemed as acceptance of the amended Policy.</p>
                        <h4 class="text-dark fw-bold">LANGUAGE</h4>
                        <p>This Policy was originally written in English and we may translate it into other languages for your convenience. In any contradiction between the versions of these Terms of Use, the provisions of the English version shall prevail.</p>
